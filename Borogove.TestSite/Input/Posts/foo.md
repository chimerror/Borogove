WARNING WARNING WARNING!
========================

A Huge Battleship Queen Jabberwock Approaches
---------------------------------------------

The warning was clear:

> Beware the Jabberwock, my son!  
> The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!  
> Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun  
> The frumious Bandersnatch!  

But, that didn't stop me.
