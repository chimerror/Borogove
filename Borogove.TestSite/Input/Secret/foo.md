A WINNER IS YOU!!!
==================

One, two! One, two! And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.

> "And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
>    Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
> O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"
>    He chortled in his joy.
